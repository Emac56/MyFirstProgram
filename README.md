Hi! I'm Jaymark Vicente from Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines.
I’m currently a 1st-year BS Information Technology student at Occidental Mindoro State College (OMSC).

This repository contains my personal Java projects, which I’ve created as part of my journey to improve my programming skills. I’m still a beginner in Java, but I’m continuously learning and striving to write clean, efficient, and professional code.

My goal is to become a junior software developer, gain real-world experience, and eventually grow into a professional software engineer.

Thank you for visiting my repository — have a great day!
